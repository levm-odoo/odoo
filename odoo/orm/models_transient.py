        (if any) are reached.

        Actual cleaning will happen only once every 5 minutes. This means this
        method can be called frequently (e.g. whenever a new record is created).

        Example with both max_hours and max_count active:

        Suppose max_hours = 0.2 (aka 12 minutes), max_count = 20, there are
        55 rows in the table, 10 created/changed in the last 5 minutes, an
        additional 12 created/changed between 5 and 10 minutes ago, the rest
        created/changed more than 12 minutes ago.

        - age based vacuum will leave the 22 rows created/changed in the last 12
          minutes
        - count based vacuum will wipe out another 12 rows. Not just 2,
          otherwise each addition would immediately cause the maximum to be
          reached again.
        - the 10 rows that have been created/changed the last 5 minutes will NOT
          be deleted
